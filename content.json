UH!\n\n[Verse 2]\nUH! The overlying U.I. is going to realize that we're all making noise dancing 'round the flames while we emphasize the flat out lies that arise cause we're all middle class frauds. UH!\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nUUUAAAAGGGGFFFFFFUUUHH!\n\n[Chorus]\nAUUGH Tiger catfish all fighting to break through the surface; we never deserved this. And still we've earned our place in the land of unconditional grace. UHHH! We're all rats in a maze thinking that we'll escape, from the haze that keeps us up all night. (Ooooh) We might never wake from the fake world we make when we break from reality. UHHH!\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'll never strive to be another one of those deplorable egg-yolk snowflakes, about to break it all apart when they fail to realize they're just as awful as the rest of us. UHH!\n\n[Verse 4]\nUH! The overlying A.I. will help us realize that we're all making eyes while dancing 'round open skies as we emphasize the flat out lies that arise (uh!) because we're middle class frauds. UH!\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nUUUAAAAGGGGFFFFFFUUUHH!\n\n[Chorus]\nAUUGH Tiger catfish all fighting for some time on the surface; we never deserved this. And still we've earned our place in the land of unconditional grace. UHHH! We're all rats in a maze thinking that we'll escape, from the haze that keeps us up all night. (Oooh) We might never wake from the fake world we make when we break from reality. UHHH!\n\no/~~~~~~~~~~~~o/\n\nUUUAAAAGGGGFFFFFFUUUHH!\n\n[Chorus]\nAUUGH Tiger's spent wish all fighting to get to the surface; we never deserved this. And still we've earned our place in the land of unconditional grace. UHHH! We're all rats in a maze thinking that we'll escape, from the haze that keeps us up all night. (Oooh) We might never wake from the fake world we make when we break from reality. UHHH!\n\n[Chorus]\nAUUGH Tiger's spent wish; all fighting to get to the surface; we never deserved this. And still we've earned our place in the land of unconditional grace. UHHH! We're all rats in a maze thinking that we'll escape, from the haze that keeps us up all night. (Oooh) We might never wake from the fake world we make when we break from reality. UHHH!\n\n(Oh, tiger spin this, fighting to swim to the surface, we didn't deserve this, no we'll never wake, we might never wake, from the fake...when we break from reality.)\n\n[End]"
