So I can't understand why you distance yourself from everyone, even me now. It makes me hurt, because in this short time maybe this is crazy, but when I think what I feel it must be real love. It must be real love.\n\n[Verse 5]\nI can't stop to think about you, I try to wait until you will text me back and tell all what happened in your life. I wait all time, and will wait forever till you will tell me that you don't want me in your life. I promise that I will never first leave you, I really hope and trust that you won't too.\n\n[Verse 6]\nMaybe I can't repair all things in your life, but take me whole and all my love at least that, please I want to be close with you every time, every time.\n\n[Chorus]\nYou made that list for me, and I saw the first page where you wrote that you love me. So I can't understand why you distance yourself from everyone, even me. It makes me hurt, cause in this short time maybe this is crazy, but when I think what I feel it must be real love. It must be real love. For real now I can't spend any day without you.\n\n[Verse 7]\nI know that you don't wanna make me hurt, but if we want to make stable relationship, you must learn to tell me about all. Cause now it goes too far, too far, when I write this song now I feel empty inside, even I know that this is not end I cry, without you my life will be hollow again.\n\n[Verse 8]\nI will do all to understand you, and accept all your defects, I have idealized you, and you will be the last one, the last one girl I gave my love. I gave my love.\n\n[End]"
